#Part I: identification and pathogenicity characterization

__Figure 1.__ Map of sampled soybean fields in 2011 and 2012, and intensity of planted soybean acres demonstrated by color intensity at the county/parish level. 

```{r map_soybean_samples, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=12}
source("code/soy_sample_map.R")

print(gg2)
print(gg3, vp=viewport(.65, .88, .4,.4))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
