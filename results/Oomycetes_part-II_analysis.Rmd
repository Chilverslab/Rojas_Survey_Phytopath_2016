## Figures and analyses

__Figure 1.__  Relative abundance of OTUs summarized by clade or genera and 
state for 2011 and 2012.  The clades or genera are color coded according to 
the legend from top to bottom

```{r clade_otu, fig.align='center', fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
ByState
```

__Figure 2.__  Oomycete community structure of species recovered from soybean 
seedling evaluated by (A) cluster analysis based on Bray-Curtis distance by 
state surveyed.  Dendrogram was constructed using hierarchical clustering with 
complete linkage; (B) diversity of oomycete communities expressed as Shannon 
index across the latitudes of the fields sampled;  (C) diversity of oomycete 
communities expressed as Shannon index across longitudes of the fields sampled.

```{r cluster_gradient, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=10}

          align = "h")
```

__Figure 3.__  Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of oomycete communities
collected from soybean seedling in the US based on a Bray-Curtis distance 
computed from taxon counts.  Environmental and edaphic factors are plotted as 
vectors based on correlations with community distance.  Only vectors with 
significant correlations are represented and the length of the vector represents
the strength of the correlation. (CEC = Cation Exchange Capacity, Season: 
corresponds to April, May and June where most planting and or sampling was 
conducted).

  geom_point(aes(color=State2, shape=Year), size = 4, alpha = 0.7) +

```

__Figure 4.__  Representation of the correlation of among community similarity 
(PCoA ordination axis) and four environmental factors: (A) seasonal 
precipitation (mm, from April - June) with samples colored by latitude; 
(B) seasonal minimum temperature (ºC, April - June) with samples colored by 
latitude; (C) clay content (%) with samples colored by volumetric water 
content (%); and (D) bulk density of the soil (gm/cm3) with samples colored by
volumetric water content (%).  Spearman correlation values (rho) and P-value are 
presented for each comparison.  Season refers to the planting and or sampling 
period which ranged from April to June.

__Figure 5.__  Distribution and abundance of the top 8 pathogenic oomycete
species across the states sampled in 2011 and 2012.
