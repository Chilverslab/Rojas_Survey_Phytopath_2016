## Figures and analyses

__Figure 1.__ Map of sampled soybean fields in 2011 and 2012, and intensity of 
planted soybean acres demonstrated by color intensity at the county/parish level.

__Figure 2.__ Frequency at which different Oomycete species were recovered from 
diseased soybean seedlings in 2011 and 2012.  (*) Species previously reported as 
associated with soybean in the fungal-host database (<http://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/fungushost/fungushost.cfm>).

__Figure 3.__  Frequency of the oomycete species summarized by clade for 2011 
and 2012. Oomycete genera outside of Pythium and Phytophthora were summarized 
by genus.  Those species designated as spp. are not well resolved based only on
the ITS sequence.

__Figure 4.__ Mean disease severity index of 84 oomycete species screened in a seed rot assay at 13ºC and 20ºC.  Bars represent standard error and disease severity index values from 0 = non-pathogenic to 100 = highly pathogenic.

__Figure 5.__ Figure 5.  (A) Hierarchical analysis of the disease severity index of 84 oomycete species to establish three clusters related to pathogenicity on soybean and (B) boxplot of disease severity index by clusters at 13°C and 20°C as evaluated in a seed rot assay.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
