Oomycete species associated with soybean seedlings in the U.S.
=======

This repository contains data and scripts used to analyze data for the manuscripts:

1. Oomycete species associated with soybean seedlings in the U.S. - Part I: identification and pathogenicity characterization
2. Oomycete species associated with soybean seedlings in the U.S. - Part II: diversity and ecology in raltion to environmental and edaphic factors

Data, code and results are contained in this project, but there are independent [Rmarkdown] documents for each analysis.
